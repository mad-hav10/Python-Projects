# Band Name Generator 🎵🐾

Welcome to the **Band Name Generator**! This simple Python project helps you create a unique band name based on your inputs.

## 📝 Description

The **Band Name Generator** takes two inputs: the name of your city and your pet's name. It then combines them to create a fun and creative band name. Whether you're starting a new music group or just having fun, this generator has you covered!

The program defines a function `band_name(city, pet)` that:
1. Takes two inputs: 
   - `city`: The name of your city.
   - `pet`: The name of your pet.
2. Combines these inputs to create a unique band name.
3. Returns the generated band name.

### Sample input and output:
- **Input**: 
  - City = "Karnal"
  - Pet = "Dog"
- **Output**: 
  - "Karnal Dog"
