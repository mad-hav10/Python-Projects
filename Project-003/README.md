# Treasure Island 🏝️💎

Welcome to **Treasure Island**! This is a simple Python adventure game where your goal is to find the treasure by making the right choices.

## 📝 Description

In **Treasure Island**, you embark on a journey filled with choices. Your decisions will determine whether you find the treasure or face defeat. Navigate through paths, make the right calls, and claim your treasure!

## 🚀 How It Works

The game progresses through a series of decisions:
1. The player chooses whether to go left or right.
2. If the player chooses left, they must decide whether to swim or wait.
