# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✊✋✌️

Welcome to the **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**! This is a Python implementation of the classic game where you play against the computer.

## 📝 Description

The **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game** allows you to test your luck and strategy by competing with a computer. Make your choice, and the program will randomly select an option for the computer. The result is then displayed based on the rules of the game.

## 🚀 How It Works

The program defines a function `RPSGame()` that:
1. Displays a prompt for the player to input their choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
2. Randomly selects a choice for the computer.
3. Compares the player's choice with the computer's choice based on the rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
4. Declares the result as a win, loss, or draw.

### Sample input and output:
- **Input**:
  - Player's choice: `rock`
  - Computer's choice: `scissors`
- **Output**:
  - `scissors`
  - "You Win!"
