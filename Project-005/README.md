# Password Generator 🔐✨

Welcome to the **Password Generator**! This Python project generates strong and random passwords based on the number of letters, numbers, and symbols specified by the user.

## 📝 Description

The **Password Generator** helps you create secure passwords by combining letters, numbers, and symbols in a random order. This ensures that the passwords are strong and difficult to guess.

## 🚀 How It Works

The program defines a function `PasswordGenerator(letter, number, symbol)` that:
1. Takes three inputs:
   - `letter`: Number of letters in the password.
   - `number`: Number of numeric digits in the password.
   - `symbol`: Number of special characters in the password.
2. Generates the specified number of letters, numbers, and symbols.
3. Combines and shuffles them randomly to create a strong password.
4. Outputs the generated password.

### Sample input and output:
- **Input**: 
  - Letters: `2`
  - Numbers: `5`
  - Symbols: `3`
- **Output**: A random password like `a3B$7*8C%`.

## 🖥️ Code Overview

The **Password Generator** is implemented in Python. Below is a brief overview of the key parts of the code:

1. **Data Initialization**:
   - Lists of possible letters, numbers, and symbols are predefined.
2. **Password Construction**:
   - Randomly selects the specified number of letters, numbers, and symbols.
   - Appends them to a `password_list`.
3. **Randomization**:
   - Shuffles the `password_list` to ensure randomness.
   - Combines the list into a single string to form the final password.

You can view the full code in the `main.py` file in the repository.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main code for the project.

## 💡 Features

- Customizable password length with specified counts of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Randomized order ensures strong and secure passwords.
- Easy to use and modify for personal requirements.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Add input validation to ensure the user provides valid counts.
- Allow the user to specify character sets (e.g., exclude ambiguous characters like `l` and `1`).
- Include a graphical user interface for better usability.
