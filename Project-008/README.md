# Secret Auction Program 💰🎉

Welcome to the **Secret Auction Program**! This is a fun and interactive way to hold a secret auction where bidders can place their bids anonymously, and the program will determine the winner.

## 📝 Description

The **Secret Auction Program** allows multiple users to place bids on an item. After all bids are entered, the program announces the highest bidder as the winner.

## 🚀 How It Works

The program:
1. Displays a logo representing the auction.
2. Prompts each bidder to enter their name and bid amount.
3. Continues to collect bids until no more bidders are left.
4. Determines the highest bid and announces the winner.

### Example:
- **Bidder 1**: Name: Alice, Bid: $200
- **Bidder 2**: Name: Bob, Bid: $300
- **Winner**: Bob, with the highest bid of $300.

## 🖥️ Code Overview

The program is implemented in Python with the following components:

1. **Auction Logo**:
   - Displays a logo for the auction when the program starts.
2. **Bid Collection**:
   - Collects names and bid amounts from users and stores them in a dictionary.
3. **Winner Determination**:
   - Once all bids are collected, the program finds the highest bid and announces the winner.
4. **User Interaction**:
   - Continues to prompt users for bids until they decide to stop.

You can find the complete implementation in the `main.py` file.
