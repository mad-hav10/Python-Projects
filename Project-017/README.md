# Turtle Race Game

A fun and interactive race game built using Python's `turtle` graphics library. Players can bet on which turtle will win the race, and the game will randomly move the turtles towards the finish line.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the Turtle Race Game.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: If necessary, to specify Python dependencies (although for this game, the default Python libraries are sufficient).

## How to Play

1. **Make a Bet**: When the game starts, a prompt will appear asking you to choose which turtle (by color) you think will win the race.
2. **Watch the Race**: Six turtles (red, yellow, blue, green, pink, orange) race to the finish line. They move forward by a random distance on each step.
3. **Winning**: The first turtle to cross the finish line wins the race. If the turtle you bet on wins, you will see a message that you won, otherwise, you'll be notified that you lost.
4. **Exit**: After the race ends, click anywhere on the screen to close the game.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-race.git
```

### Run the Game

Navigate to the project directory and run the `main.py` script:

```bash
cd turtle-race
python main.py
```

Make sure Python is installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x).

## Features

- **Random Turtle Movement**: Each turtle moves a random distance on each iteration, making the race unpredictable.
- **User Interaction**: Players can make a bet on which turtle they think will win.
- **Colorful Graphics**: The game uses Python's `turtle` graphics library to display the turtles and the race.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (turtle graphics library comes pre-installed with Python)

## Example
